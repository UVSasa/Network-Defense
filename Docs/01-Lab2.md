# 🔐 Blue Team Detection Lab – Brute Force Attack Detection & Response

## 📖 Overview

In this lab, I focused on **detecting and actively responding** to brute force login attempts against a Windows machine. This includes both **local account login attempts** and **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** login attempts. My goal was to simulate attacker behavior and use **Wazuh’s detection and active response features** to identify and block malicious activity.

Using Wazuh documentation and built-in rule capabilities, I was able to:
- Detect failed logon attempts from Windows Event Logs (Security log)
- Trigger alerts using Wazuh’s ruleset for known event IDs (e.g., `4625`)
- Configure **Active Response** to automatically block suspicious IPs

This setup simulates a realistic **defensive response** to an attacker trying to guess passwords, which is a common and serious threat in real-world environments.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect brute force login attempts using Windows Security logs
- Monitor both local and RDP login failures
- Configure Wazuh to generate alerts based on failed login event volume
- Enable Active Response to automatically block attacker IPs
- Understand how brute force attacks are used by threat actors

## 🔍 Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

Brute force attacks are one of the most common and automated forms of intrusion. Threat actors often use:
- **Username/password guessing scripts**
- **Credential stuffing attacks** using leaked credentials
- **RDP brute force** to gain remote access to a machine

If left undetected, a successful brute force attempt can give an attacker direct access to a system — often with elevated privileges.

Early detection and immediate response (e.g., blocking the source IP) are critical to preventing unauthorized access.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Wazuh Manager** – for rule evaluation and Active Response
- **Wazuh Agent** – installed on Windows endpoint to forward logs
- **Windows Event Logs** – source of Security events (e.g., Event ID 4625)
- **Active Response** – configured to trigger block actions on alert
- **Sysinternals & Event Viewer** – used for verification and local inspection

## 📂 Windows Events Monitored

| Event ID | Description                 |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| `4625`   | Failed logon attempt         |
| `4624`   | Successful logon             |
| `4627`   | RDP-related logon failures   |
| `4672`   | Privileged logon             |
