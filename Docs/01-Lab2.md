# üîê Blue Team Detection Lab ‚Äì Brute Force Attack Detection & Response

## üìñ Overview

In this lab, I focused on **detecting and actively responding** to brute force login attempts against a Windows machine. This includes both **local account login attempts** and **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** login attempts. My goal was to simulate attacker behavior and use **Wazuh‚Äôs detection and active response features** to identify and block malicious activity.

Using Wazuh documentation and built-in rule capabilities, I was able to:
- Detect failed logon attempts from Windows Event Logs (Security log)
- Trigger alerts using Wazuh‚Äôs ruleset for known event IDs (e.g., `4625`)
- Configure **Active Response** to automatically block suspicious IPs

This setup simulates a realistic **defensive response** to an attacker trying to guess passwords, which is a common and serious threat in real-world environments.

## üéØ Objectives

- Detect brute force login attempts using Windows Security logs
- Monitor both local and RDP login failures
- Configure Wazuh to generate alerts based on failed login event volume
- Enable Active Response to automatically block attacker IPs
- Understand how brute force attacks are used by threat actors

## üîç Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

Brute force attacks are one of the most common and automated forms of intrusion. Threat actors often use:
- **Username/password guessing scripts**
- **Credential stuffing attacks** using leaked credentials
- **RDP brute force** to gain remote access to a machine

If left undetected, a successful brute force attempt can give an attacker direct access to a system ‚Äî often with elevated privileges.

Early detection and immediate response (e.g., blocking the source IP) are critical to preventing unauthorized access.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Wazuh Manager** ‚Äì for rule evaluation and Active Response
- **Wazuh Agent** ‚Äì installed on Windows endpoint to forward logs
- **Windows Event Logs** ‚Äì source of Security events (e.g., Event ID 4625)
- **Active Response** ‚Äì configured to trigger block actions on alert
- **Sysinternals & Event Viewer** ‚Äì used for verification and local inspection

## üìÇ Windows Events Monitored

| Event ID | Description                 |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| `4625`   | Failed logon attempt         |
| `4624`   | Successful logon             |
| `4627`   | RDP-related logon failures   |
| `4672`   | Privileged logon             |

## üõ† Wazuh Configuration

At first when simulating the brute-force attack the logs showed us multiple single logon failures as well one log that lets us know that multiple logon failures have occured in a brief period of time.

The goal for this lab was to make sure that if wazuh saw this happening it would not only log it, but add the sourceip address to the block list. Below show the active configuration I used, all its saying is that when rule 60204 is triggered(*mulitple failed logon from previous picture) wazuh will run the netsh script that will block the sourceip address on the local agent for 180 seconds.

When the netsh script is run an alert fires.
